I  received my bachelorâ€™s degrees (summa cum laude) in Aerospace and Ocean Engineering from [Virginia Tech](https://www.aerohydroacoustics.com/) in 2016 after which I worked as a Naval Architect & Marine Engineer primarily serving the Gulf of Mexico's [offshore energy](https://www.minomarine.com/) and the Great Lakes' [bulk-carrier](https://netsco.us/) sectors.  At present, I am wrapping up my graduate studies (Mechanical Engineering) while conducting research in UBC's [Computational Multiphysics Lab](https://cml.mech.ubc.ca/research/) under the supervision of [Dr. Rajeev Jaiman](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&user=iofAU68AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My research is focused on the development of robust, efficient, and scalable coupling algorithms for the [(partitioned) high-fidelity simulation](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Multi-Threaded_Partitioned_FSI) of fluid-structure-acoustic phenomenon. The intended outcome of my work, as part of the broader NSERC funded "future intelligent and green marine vessels (IGMVs)" project, is to support ongoing simulation-driven efforts to reduce the underwater noise pollution generated by maritime traffic. 

Being insatiably curious and a passionate learner; if you have any interesting opportunities, need assistance on a technical task, or would like to discuss emerging trends in computational physics or the martime economy feel free to reach out to me. I am most easily accessible via my personal email address given below.

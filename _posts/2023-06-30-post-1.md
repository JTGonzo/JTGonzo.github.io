## Probelm Statement
In order to study the ["*coupling  instability of low mass-ratio partitioned FSI simulations*"](https://jtgonzo.github.io/) I first needed to develop a robust partitioned numerical framework that was able to capably handle the challenges of problematic FSI simulation configurations. To this end, after much struggling and wondering in the dark, I was **FINALLY** able to develop a suite of 2D and 3D high-fidelity [partitioned FSI codes](](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Partitioned_FSI)). Achieving this feat is a source of real personal pride; as without proper guidance or an intimate knowledge of the fundamental instability intrinsic to the problem, great effort  was required (often involving numerous protracted periods of brutal trial and error) to amass a complete and homogenous set of numerical tools to tackle this difficult problem.

In the end (having experimented on the gamut of available open-source resources) the majority of my eventually developed code-based was derived from a source [(redbKIT-based) monolithic FSI](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Monolithic_FSI) solver. These solvers were decomposed from the original [toolkit](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT) into their baseline elements and were then strategically reassembled and further built upon until a sufficiently robust **partitioned** FSI scheme was attained. In particular, was the required integration of appropriate conservative Dirchlet and Neummann interfacial boundary conditions into the (independently treated) fluid and structural solvers, respectively. These additions, as well as all of the other requisite algorithmic logic, interfacial data mapping, and iterative stabalization techniques were also added thus make the partitoned codes developed here a "semi"-unique product in their own right.

## Framework Validation
To validate the accuracy of the developed partitioned framework, I **successfully** compared my results collected from three challenging FSI benchmarks againts both those results provided in the literature and that produced by established commercial software. These results served mainly to demonstrate the accuracy of the domain solvers themselves and, generally speaking, the robustness of the partitioned scheme to handle complex FSI problems with strong added-mass effects, high structural nonlinearity, and considerable mesh deformation. The benchmarks successfully reproduced included;

<ins>**Benchmark Cases**</ins><br>
<ul>
    <li> 2D Incompressible Flow over a Vertically Cantilevered (Linear) Elastic Beam</li>
    <li> 2D Incompressible Flow over a Horizonatlly Cantilevered (Nonlinear) Elastic Beam</li>
    <li> 3D Pressure Pulse Propogation through an Elastic Tube</li>
</ul>

details of the validation procedure as well as the confirming results generated via the study are given on this website's companion [projects](https://jtgonzo.github.io/projects/) page.
